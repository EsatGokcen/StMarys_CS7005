                <h2>The Hateful Eight</h2>
                <p>
                    Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight is a heartwarming tale of friendship, trust, and mutual respect… until you actually watch it. Then you realise it's just eight angry people in the Wild West, slowly figuring out the best ways to betray and brutally murder each other in a snowstorm.
                    Set in a cozy little cabin filled with lies, bullets, and enough blood to make a vampire say, "Alright, that's a bit much," the film follows bounty hunters, outlaws, and cowboys who all have one thing in common: pure, unfiltered hatred for each other. Picture a family Christmas dinner, but instead of passive-aggressive insults, people just shoot each other in the face.
                    Samuel L. Jackson plays Major Marquis Warren, a bounty hunter who probably has the best poker face in cinematic history—because if you blink in this movie, you're either poisoned, shot, or both. Kurt Russell is the tough, no-nonsense John Ruth, aka The Hangman, whose life motto is: Why have a calm conversation when you can pistol-whip someone instead? And Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue? Let's just say she makes every family gathering look peaceful in comparison.
                    As the tension builds, you'll find yourself thinking, "Surely, they'll start working together to survive!" But this is Tarantino, so no, they absolutely will not. Instead, they'll unravel every last thread of human decency before turning the entire cabin into a crime scene that would make a forensic scientist quit their job.
                    But hey, don't let that stop you from watching it with your mom! Nothing strengthens the parent-child bond quite like awkwardly laughing together while someone gets their head blown off. Tarantino films: bringing families closer, one bloodbath at a time.
