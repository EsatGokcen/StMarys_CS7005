                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>Welcome to <strong>Shrek and Chill</strong>, where we respect your privacy as much as 
                Shrek respects his swamp. This Privacy Policy explains what we do (or don't do) with 
                your data, assuming we even know how to collect it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-div">
                <h2>1. Data We Collect (Spoiler: None)</h2>
                <p>We collect absolutely no personal data, cookies, or magic beans. If you see an ad for 
                "Swamp Real Estate Investment Opportunities," that's not from us—that's probably just 
                Lord Farquaad trying to track you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-div">
                <h2>2. How We Use Your Data (We Don't)</h2>
                <p>Since we don't collect your data, we obviously don't use it. However, if we ever do, 
                it will only be to determine whether you're a true Shrek fan or just a casual viewer 
                who needs to reconsider their life choices.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-div">
                <h2>3. Third-Party Sharing (We Keep Secrets Better Than Donkey)</h2>
                <p>We don't share your information with third parties, including but not limited to:
                <ul class="privacy-list">
                    <li>Kingdom of Far Far Away</li>
                    <li>The Muffin Man</li>
                    <li>Fairy Godmother's Legal Team</li>
                    <li>The Mirror That Spies on People</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>However, if you willingly share your details with a talking donkey, that's on you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-div">
                <h2>4. Cookies Policy (The Only Cookies Here Are Gingerbread)</h2>
                <p>We don't track cookies, but if we did, they'd be made of gingerbread and possibly 
                screaming in terror. If a cookie asks you for your credit card details, 
                do NOT comply.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-div">
                <h2>5. Security (Ogres Have Layers, We Don't)</h2>
                <p>Our security policy is simple: since we don't collect your data, there's 
                nothing to hack. That said, if you hear rustling in the bushes, 
                it might be Puss in Boots stealing your WiFi.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-div">
                <h2>6. Your Rights (Yes, You Have Some)</h2>
                <p>You have the right to:
                    <ul class="privacy-list">
                        <li>Enjoy Shrek-related content freely.</li>
                        <li>Refuse to accept any cookies—because we don't use them anyway.</li>
                        <li>Not take this Privacy Policy seriously.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-div">
                <h2>7. Changes to This Policy (Whenever We Feel Like It)</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to update this policy anytime, most likely when we realize 
                we don't know what we're doing. Check back periodically, or don't—it won't change 
                anything.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-div">
                <h2>8. Contact Us (Or Don't, We're Not Checking)</h2>
                <p>If you have any concerns about your privacy, please shout "SomeBODY once told me…" 
                into the night sky, and we may or may not respond.</p>
                <p>Now that you understand our privacy policy, please return to 
                    <a href="index.html">Shrek and Chill</a> and continue your ogre-related adventures 
                    worry-free.</p>
