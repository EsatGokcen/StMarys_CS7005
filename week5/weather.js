/* 
- Create a new JavaScript file named weather.js in this week's sub-directory of your project.
- Define an async function called getWeather(city) that:
- Simulates fetching weather data using setTimeout().
- If the city is "London", it should resolve with { temperature: 20, condition: "Sunny" }.
- If any other city is entered, it should reject with "City not found".
- Use try...catch to handle errors and log the result.
- Extend the function by adding displayWeather(weatherData), which logs The weather in {city} 
is {temperature}Â°C and {condition}..
- Call getWeather("London") and getWeather("Paris") and handle both success and error cases.
- Test your implementation and verify it functions as expected.
- Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.
